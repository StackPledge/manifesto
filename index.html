    <h1><span class="logo">≡</span> Stack Pledge Manifesto</h1>
    <p>
        We are software engineers and we love to optimize things.<br />
        We are aware, that we live in a world where the use of computers, infrastructure and data centers emits a lot of
        CO₂.<br />
        Therefore we want to optimize our stack decisions for long-term quality of life on this planet in the
        future.<br />
    </p>
    <p>As such, we are proud to say that we value:

        <ul>
            <li><mark>Static Site Generators</mark> over serverside rendered pages. ☑️</li>

            <li><mark>Serverless functions and orchestrated containers</mark> over customized, but unused metal and
                VMs. ❓</li>

            <li><mark>Hosted storage solutions</mark> over idling database servers. ☑️</li>

            <li><mark>Datacenters powered by renewables</mark> over buying certificates. ☑️</li>

            <li><mark>Data avoidance</mark> over intense tracking ☑️</li>

            <li><mark>Working on our products core</mark>, instead of rebuilding stuff already available from
                establishedsuppliers.
                ☑️</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>We are aware that we can't change everything right away, but we pledge to optimize our stacks through those
        values for future decisions within our range.</p>
    <h2>Sign the manifesto</h2>
    <p>I sign the above manifesto voluntarily and honorary. <br />By signing it with my github account, my name will be
        listed here publicly.</p>

    <button type="button" onclick="alert('this is only a demo.'); return false;">Sign with Github</button>

    <h2>Join the community</h2>
    <p>
        One more thing: This is not just about signing and forgetting.<br />
        It is about building a movement of software engineers who actively question their deceissions, discussing
        details of implementations, offer sparring to each other and last but not least question the whole manifest
        continuously to actively develop it further and further. </p>

    <h2>tl;dr / non-engineers version</h2>

    <blockquote>Living in a world with more and more computaion, a movement of software engineers is commiting to
        optimize their technological decisions to emit less and less CO₂.</blockquote>
    <h2>Roadmap</h2>

    <h3>Phase 1: Achieve movement society fit</h3>
    <p>Stack Pledge is a grassroots movement based on the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations" target="_blank">diffusion theory by Everett
            Rogers</a>, which says that 2.5% of a population is enough to enforce an idea.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <u>Manifesto:</u> The first version is public and is discussed in a small circle of interested engineers
            activists.
        </li>
        <li>
            <u>Collect signatures:</u> Signing the manifest with a github account is currently under Development.
        </li>
        <li>
            <u>Assumption tool:</u> A demo can be found by clicking on the first two manifesto theses. Currently in the
            phase of searching funds for an interactive open source tool to publicly collect facts and shape hypotheses
            in the climate context.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Phase 2: Scale</h3>
    <p>After enough individual engineers are on board and the manifesto has become a consensus reality, the Stack Pledge
        needs to achieve a corporate level. This phase starts when the manifesto is signed by <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering_demographics" target="_blank">21,000,000</a>*2.5%
        = 525,000 software engineers. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Companies share and discuss their stack publicly on an url like stackpledge.org/~companyname
        </li>
        <li>
            Certification
        </li>
        <li>Coaching</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Signatories</h2>
    <p>All those people already pledged their stack decisions:</p>
